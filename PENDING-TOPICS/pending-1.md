Constructor functions and factory functions are both used to create objects in JavaScript, but they have some differences in how they work and how they are implemented.

1. **Constructor Function**:

   - A constructor function is a function that is used with the `new` keyword to create instances (objects) of a particular type or class.
   - It uses the `this` keyword to define properties and methods that will be attached to instances of the object.
   - Constructor functions are typically named with PascalCase (capitalized first letter).
   - When invoked with the `new` keyword, they automatically create and return a new object.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function Person(name, age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
       this.sayHello = function () {
         console.log(
           `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`
         );
       };
     }
     const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
     ```

2. **Factory Function**:
   - A factory function is a function that returns an object. It does not require the use of the `new` keyword.
   - It can create and return objects based on parameters passed to it.
   - Factory functions are typically named with camelCase (starting with a lowercase letter).
   - They encapsulate the object creation process and may include additional logic before returning the object.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function createPerson(name, age) {
       return {
         name: name,
         age: age,
         sayHello() {
           console.log(
             `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`
           );
         },
       };
     }
     const person2 = createPerson("Bob", 25);
     ```

Key Differences:

- Constructor functions use the `new` keyword to create instances, while factory functions return new objects directly.
- Constructor functions define properties and methods using `this`, while factory functions define them as part of the object literal returned.
- Constructor functions automatically return a new object, while factory functions explicitly return objects.

The choice between constructor functions and factory functions depends on the specific use case and coding style preferences. Both approaches are valid and widely used in JavaScript.
