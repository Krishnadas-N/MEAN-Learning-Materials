In Angular, `forwardRef` is a utility that allows you to create references to components, directives, or services that are not yet defined. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have circular dependencies or when you need to reference something that hasn't been fully defined at the time of reference.

The `forwardRef` function is typically used when you have a situation where a class refers to itself or refers to something else that has not yet been defined.

Here's a basic example of how `forwardRef` is used:

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';

// Assume that SomeDirective is defined later in the file or in another file
// We use forwardRef to reference SomeDirective which is not yet defined
@Directive({
  selector: '[appSomeDirective]',
  providers: [{ provide: SomeService, useExisting: forwardRef(() => SomeDirective) }]
})
export class SomeDirective {
  constructor(private elementRef: ElementRef) { }
}

// SomeService is declared later in the file or in another file
// Here, we can use SomeDirective even though it's defined later in the file
@Injectable()
export class SomeService {
  constructor(private someDirective: SomeDirective) { }
}
```

In this example, `SomeDirective` and `SomeService` are referencing each other. `SomeService` needs `SomeDirective`, and vice versa. However, since `SomeDirective` is defined later in the file (or in another file), we use `forwardRef` to create a reference to `SomeDirective` in the `providers` array of the `@Directive` decorator.

This way, Angular knows how to resolve the reference to `SomeDirective` even though it hasn't been defined yet when `SomeService` is instantiated.

`forwardRef` helps Angular's dependency injection system to resolve dependencies when they have not yet been defined at the time of referencing.
